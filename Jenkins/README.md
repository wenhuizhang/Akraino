# Jenkins

Jenkins is a software automation tool for shipping softwares remotely.
It gives out possibilities of shipping whole software stack (bootloader, OS, hypervisor, applications) to a bare metal cluster.

P.S. 
Bare metal here means we only have BIOS on top of hardwares. 


On the localhost:8080 as default(or whatever server and port you are working on), go to `Manage Jenkins` and then choose `Configure System ` , `Manage Users`and `Configure global security` etc. for security access control settings.
